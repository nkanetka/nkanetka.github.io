Compass is a technology based real estate company based in Manhattan and with offices in numerous major US cities. Going into this term I wanted to get a good understanding of how to build a production level app. During this term, my main project was to re-architect the [Compass Markets app][markets-app-store]{:target="_blank"}, leveraging MVVM in `Swift`, increasing testability of the app by 75%. I also rewrote al unit tests in the app eliminating 2 dependencies on the codebase. Finally, during a company wide hackathon I designed and implemented a novel solution to download and inform users of nearby listings via geo-fenced notifications, without requiring additional user permissions. Over the term, I was exposed to good coding practices with `Swift`, continuous integration and architecting apps.
