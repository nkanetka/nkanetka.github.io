[Nanoleaf][nanoleaf]{:target="_blank"} is a medium sized startup based in Toronto and Shenzhen, China. The start of my term was exciting as it coincided with the launch of their new product, the [Nanoleaf Aurora][nanoleaf-aurora]{:target="_blank"}, a modular smart lighting product. My role as an iOS developer was to take the app and improve it to make customers experiences with Nanoleaf products better. In this role I reduced customer support calls by 20% by implementing a flow within to app that guides users who are having trouble pairing with the Aurora, established the use of feature documents to clearly communicate needs between business, design and engineering teams, architected and built out a feature that allows users to download scenes that Nanoleaf features and worked on smaller tasks to improve the overall UI/UX of the app, such as making the app iPad compatible. One of the biggest roles I had was helping define a vision for the app so that it would clearly fit into the existing ecosystem of Nanoleaf products.
