At CIBC, I worked on the CIBC trading floor in the Equity Markets Technology Division ensuring that trades went through without any issues. Much of my role was Project Management to ensure that we knew where servers physically were and making sure that we had logs of maintenance on servers. In this job my responsibilities were to keep a log of server changes and note any difference to what we have on file and to create a log of total daily trades on each server so that we have an exact record of the number of trades going through each server. Over the course of my term, I conducted an audit of unused trading connections resulting in $2,000 of savings for CIBC per month and developed a `VBA` script to automatically record the number of daily trades reducing the time spent on the task by 15-25 minutes.
