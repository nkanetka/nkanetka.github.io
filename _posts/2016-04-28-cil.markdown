Founded in the fall of 2014, The Canon Innovation Lab is a small team of designers and developers working to rapidly generate and implement ideas to respond to the evolving needs in the photography space. The start of my term at the Lab was exciting as it marked the beginning of production development for Jumpshot, the Lab's first prototype to go out to users. At Canon, I organized developers to start following a Git flow structure for branching to ensure bugs were isolated. I also got the chance to build a variety of different prototypes within the post capture space which exposed me to technologies such as OpenCV (`Objective-C++`), `D3.js` and `Python`.
