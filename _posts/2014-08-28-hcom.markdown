The HCOM Lab is a multi-disciplinary lab that studies how humans interact with complex systems. My role as a research assistant was to help Master's student Samuel Lien with the design of a pilot and Air Traffic Controller (ATC) interface, help collect data and help analyze the data after the completion of the study. In this role, I recruited pilots and ATC through social media, forums, blogs and personal contacts, organized the scheduling of pilots and ATC so that the study could be conducted at times that work both all parties (pilots, ATC and us), analyzed the recordings of the study for keywords and phrases that would be used to create results and contributed to the design of the interfaces using knowledge of both ATC and pilot interfaces.
