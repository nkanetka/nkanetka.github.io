Hey there, thanks for dropping by! I'm currently in 3B at the University of Waterloo. My interests vary from anything space or flying related to learning about technology and how to use it to effectively solve problems. Click one of the buttons above to learn more about my side projects, where I have worked or take a look at my resume. Feel free to shoot me a message if you have any questions.
