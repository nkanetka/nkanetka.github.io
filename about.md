Hey there, thanks for dropping by! I'm currently in 3B at the University of Waterloo. My interests vary from anything space or flying related to learning about technology and how to use it to effectively solve problems. Click to learn more about my [personal projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/), where I have [worked]({{ site.url }}/experience/) or take a look at my [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/Resume.pdf).

As for what is next, I am currently looking for an iOS coop/internship for the summer of 2017.

Again, thanks for dropping by. Feel free to shoot me a [message](mailto:{{site.email}}) if you have any questions.

<!-- My past coop experiences have ranged from R&D to rapid prototyping to production iOS development. Lately, I have been doing a lot of iOS working to create great user experiences that solve users problems. -->
