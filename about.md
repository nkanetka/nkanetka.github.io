### About Me

Hey there, thanks for dropping by! I'm currently in 3B at the [University of Waterloo][uw-syde]{:target="_blank"}. My interests vary from anything space or flying related to learning about technology and how to use it to effectively solve problems. In my free time I enjoy [flying]({{ site.url }}/projects/pilot/) (I have approximately 135 hours in the air), taking [photos][flickr]{:target="_blank"} or working on a side project. Click to learn more about my [personal projects]({{ site.url }}/projects/), where I have [worked]({{ site.url }}/experience/) or take a look at my [resume]({{ site.url }}/assets/Resume.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

As for what is next, I am currently looking for an iOS coop/internship for the summer of 2017.

Again, thanks for dropping by. Feel free to shoot me a [message](mailto:{{site.email}}) if you have any questions.
